# GDquest Projects

We use this repository at GDquest to organize our work and tasks on video production, tools, and regroup our guidelines in one place.

We're doing this work publicly so you can use our guidelines if you so desire, and learn from our workflow.

This is **not** a place to request tutorials. However, as with everything we do, constructive feedback on our guidelines and suggestions to improve our process and content in general are always welcome!

You can always find us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/87NNb3Z)
