# GDquest Projects

We use this repository at GDquest to track issues and organize our work and tasks on video production and tools. Issues that are general to our projects but don't fit in other repositories.

We used this repository to get work started on our [Free Software contribution guides](https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/).

You can now find them on the GDquest website:

[Godot GDScript best practices](https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guidelines/godot-gdscript/)
[Blender Python best practices](https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guidelines/blender-python/)
[Making great tutorials guide](https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guidelines/gdquest-videos/)
[Contributing to GDquest's projects](https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guidelines/kind-communication-guidelines/)
[Kind communication guidelines](https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guidelines/contributing-to-gdquest-projects/)

We're doing this work publicly so you can use our guidelines if you so desire, and learn from our workflow.

This is **not** a place to request tutorials. However, as with everything we do, constructive feedback on our guidelines and suggestions to improve our process and content in general are always welcome!
